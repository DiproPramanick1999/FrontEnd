Authentication module is programmed into implementing the following features. 

Feature name: View Login Info 

The sub-feature to be programmed is to display the username while viewing the user’s login info.  

UI RULES: 

User Login portal is designed using html and bootstrap. 

The general requirements are username and password either to login as a Doctor or Patient. 

Form is designed to accept the username and password. 

A “Log-In" button is displayed which will navigate the user to the dashboard when the credentials are authenticated. 

If the password is wrong, an alert message is displayed to notify the user. 

The navigation bar is a component used from bootstrap to display the clinic name and doctor’s name.  

To the left-most corner, user name is displayed with a dropdown feature alongside their profile picture. 

Data Rules: 

The data which is used in the portal is accessed through a JSON file. 

To use the JSON file along with TypeScript, import the .json file and access the different fields by dot operator. 

Business RULES: 

In the login portal, you can either login as a doctor or a patient. By using click function, we validate the type of role. When “log in as doctor” is clicked, the type field is assigned the value “Doctor” and vice-versa when the type field is Patient. 

The Log-In button when clicked, checks if the typed password is the same as the password given in JSON file. 

Routing is done through navigate function which is called when we click on the Log-In button. 

The username in the dashboard’s navbar is by accessing the username given in the json data file.
